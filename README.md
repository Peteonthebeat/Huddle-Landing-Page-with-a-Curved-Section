### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I exercised my flexbox skills. Initially I used Grid for the sections, but eventually did everything with Flexbox for convenience. I'd rather use Grid for sections with multiple rows and columns. 


### Continued development
I plan to proceed doing such challenges on the Frontend Mentor Website.
